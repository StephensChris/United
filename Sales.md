# Door to Door:

## Pitch:

*Hey, how's it going? 

I'm Nathan. My business partner, Chris, and I run a small, wallet-friendly lawn care business. 

Just wanted to see if you have a sec to hear about what we offer.*

### If they say NO

No worries!

Mind if I leave a card with you in case you change your mind? 

If the person says Yes and they are:

[Kind] - Awesome, we offer free estimates, so it couldn't hurt to at least get a price. 

[Funny] - Sweet! Chris is pretty flexible with pricing, so you might be able to talk him into a good deal.

[Dismissive] - {Jump to end}

If the person says no:

No worries, we are easy to find on Facebook

I appreciate your time. Have a great day!
