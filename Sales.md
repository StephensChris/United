# Door to Door:

## Pitch

*Hey, how's it going?*

*I'm Nathan. My business partner, Chris, and I run a small, wallet-friendly lawn care business.*

*Just wanted to see if you have a sec to hear about what we do.*

## If they say NO (to pitch):

*No worries! Mind if I leave a card with you?*

## If they say YES (to card) and they are:

### [Kind]

Awesome, we do free estimates, so it couldn't hurt to at least get a price. 
<br>
*And there's no pressure to commit, if you ever wanted to get a rough price, or shop around, in the future.*

### [Funny]

Sweet! Chris is pretty flexible with pricing, so you might be able to talk him into a good deal.

### [Dismissive]

## If they say NO (to card):

No worries, we are easy to find on Facebook, it's just "United Lawn Care".

I appreciate your time and have a great day!
