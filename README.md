<h1> 
Q: How much do you charge?

<br>
A: We try to be as affordable and understanding as possible and will work with your budget as much as we can. We don't really like giving out numbers until we see the property with our own eyes, just to eliminate the possibility of miscommunication. 
</h1>

### Example (Don't say directly to customer)

What they may consider to be a large lawn may, by our standards, be a medium-sized lawn and if we over-the-phone quoted them $20 more than they would have payed for a medium lawn, that could deter them from selecting us.

<h1> 
Q: Can you come all the way out to {such and such}?

#### Don't even mention this unless they ask about ***Grants Pass*** or ***Ashland***

# A: Generally we try to stay close to the Medford/Central Point/Four Corners area, but we are willing to travel for a relatively small trip charge, dependent on the distance.
</h1>

## Rates may vary upon actual distance. Make sure to get an address. 
General rule of thumb is 1 mile from CP = +1%. 

If the time it takes to get there is close to double the mileage, do +1.5% instead.
```
City            Dist.   Trip Chrg.
Grants Pass     25 mi         +25%      (Tell customer about charge)
Ashland         20 mi         +20%      (Tell customer about charge)

Talent          15 mi         +15%
Rogue River     15 mi         +15%

Eagle Point     10 mi         +10%     
Phoenix         10 mi         +10%
Gold Hill       10 mi         +10%


No Charge for the following:
    Medford
    Central Point
    Jacksonville
    Four Corners

A: At the moment, we are not licensed, bonded or insured. In the state of Oregon, a license is not required in order to perform "landscape maintenance" services. Part of keeping United affordable is our freedom and flexibility to avoid the extra costs that come with becoming licensed, bonded and insured.

<h1> 
Q: Is there anything else you think I should know about?

<br>
A1. ) Referral Program

## 5$ off your recurring bill for every **recurring** customer you refer us to, for life! (Maxed out at full recurring bill amount)
Example: Customer's bill is $20, if they refer 4 ***recurring*** customers, they will have their lawn mowed for free. And even if they refer more recurring customers, they can no longer reduce their bill, unless they require more services, thus organically increasing their bill.

---

</h1>

<br>

# A2. ) A deal you can count on!

### Example:

Once a deal for, say, $30/visit is reached, that rate is locked in for 1 year and will not change under any circumstances.

***This does NOT include change orders.***

If they want us to provide extra services on a recurring basis (ie. adding hedge trimming to their biweekly visit), they will get the same rate (ie. $30/visit + $10/hedge trimming), but the bill will (predictably) increase.
